# Operating System and Concurrency coursework

Step 1: Run the .c files (RoundRobin, MLFQ, etc..) using the relevant program (codeblock/ c free / online compiler)

Step 2: Build and run the files in the compiler.

Step 3: Input the number of processes wanted.

Step 4: Enter the burst time for each process (arrival time of all process is assumed to be 0).

Step 5 (Optional) : In the MLFQ and RoundRobin setup, a further input, `time quantum`, is required. (Time quantum = time allowed for each process before it is paused and another process begins to run)

Step 6: The results will be printed on the screen.
